Torrent Suite™ Software Database User Guide ===========================================Introduction------------The Database User Guide describes how to work with the experiment metadata and analysis results stored in the Ion Torrent database. Refer to the Database Schema Reference for a detailed description of database content and structure.The Torrent Server includes PostgreSQL, which is an open-source object-relational Database Management System (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs. PostgreSQL APIs are available for the most popular programming languages to build applications using the database for backend data store. The main user interface to PostgreSQL is the ``psql`` command line program. The psql program permits you to enter database queries directly from a terminal or to execute a query sequence from a file. Database queries demonstrated in this guide use ``psql``.This document, as part of the Torrent Suite™ Software SDK, shows how to manipulate the database using the command line and complements the API, which provides a programmatic way of accessing the database... toctree::    :maxdepth: 2    manual_database_ug/getting_started_with_postgresql.rst    manual_database_ug/database_access_examples.rst
