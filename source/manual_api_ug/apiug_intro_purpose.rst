Purpose
=======

The API User Guide presents background and conceptual information to provide context for using the Torrent Suite™ Software API.

You should already have a basic understanding of software development related to web services, and familiarity with the Torrent Browser user interface. The purpose of this document is to focus that basic knowledge in the area of the Torrent Suite™ Software web service, showing how the API is implemented and the mechanisms available for developing applications that take full advantage of Torrent Suite functionality exposed by the API.

Once you know the basic architecture and concepts behind the API, you are encouraged to work through the :ref:`api-cook` as a hands-on way to discover API functionality in a step-by-step way.
