cURL
====

The Client URL Library (cURL) is a command line utility to transfer files using URL syntax.

The ``cURL`` utility is useful for interactively making REST requests. Using ``cURL`` gives you more control and flexibility than using a program while you learn the API and debug the communication part of your application.

You can download and install cURL from `http://curl.haxx.se/docs/ <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/>`_.
