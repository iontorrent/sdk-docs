Work with the File System
=========================

Using the API, you can find and download analysis results files.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    ./ts_downloadfastqfile.rst
    ./ts_listfileservers.rst	

In addition to the FASTQ example, other files included in the results resource include the BAM, test fragment BAM, and default report files. The reference genome file can be also located and downloaded using the link in the ``referencegenome`` resource.

This example demonstrates the unique way files are referenced using the REST API.
