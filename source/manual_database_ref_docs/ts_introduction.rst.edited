	API topics are presented in the form of examples that are "recipes" for mastering each of the various topics. The examples are arranged in order, from the simplest "hello, world" type of application to increasingly complex functionality, where each depends on the understanding gained in previous examples. Each example demonstrates a real-world application that can be easily extended. From the basic operations involved in retrieving data through selecting and sorting data and, finally, updating data and creating new resource objects, you gain the knowledge needed to begin your own application development.
