REST Clients============Browser-based REST clients are available for Firefox and Chrome browsers. You can download and install these clients at the following locations:* `Firefox REST Client <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/restclient/>`_* `Chrome REST Client <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-rest-client/fhjcajmcbmldlhcimfajhfbgofnpcjmb>`_Like the cURL utility, a REST client is useful for interactively making REST requests, giving you more control and flexibility than using a program when learning the API and debugging the communication part of your application.A Python-based REST client is also available for download and installation at the following location:* `RESTClient <http://restclient.org/>`_
